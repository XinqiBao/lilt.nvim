# Design contracts

The ordinary listed manuscript buffer is the only authored-text authority.
Reference text is a session snapshot. Comparisons, highlights, hints, and virtual
lines are disposable derived state. Lilt never intercepts typing or repairs text.

`work.lua` validates self-contained JSON works and reads reference text.
`library.lua` discovers directories, installs local copies through hidden
staging, and derives manuscript paths and saved progress. `init.lua` provides
configuration and native selection/input callbacks. Neither view knows about
manifests, library paths, installation, or persistence. The bundled sample uses
the same work loader and session with a retained unnamed manuscript.

There is one active session. Selecting another unit closes its presentation and
retains the previous ordinary buffer; file-backed units reuse Neovim's buffer
registry. Closing preserves unsaved edits with `bufhidden=hide`, so ordinary
quit/delete protections continue to apply. The last reading can reopen in either
view without a library lookup. There is no durable session or cursor registry;
saved files are the only persistent reading state.

## Boundaries and lifecycle

`manuscript.lua` prepares ordinary named or temporary buffers, reusing Neovim's
buffer registry for files and creating parents on native writes. `session.lua`
accepts an explicit manuscript buffer and reference snapshot; it coordinates
buffer attachment, view changes, and window-option restoration. Ghost owns its
presentation, hint timer, float, and autocmds. Split owns its reference buffer and
window. `compare.lua` is independent of Neovim UI; `render.lua` supplies the shared
namespace and clearing operation. Commands in `plugin/lilt.lua` call the small
public interface in `lua/lilt/init.lua`.

Ownership follows window IDs across native rearrangement. Before presentation
changes, options are saved against the window being changed. A native split
inherits its source window's options, so Split restores the manuscript window
before creating the reference window, then applies presentation to both. This
keeps Lilt's own quiet options and statusline out of the new window's baseline.
Assigning a buffer can reset window-local options; reapply presentation while
retaining the editor baseline captured before that assignment.
Repurposed or final surviving windows restore their pre-presentation editor
options. Global options and unrelated windows are not managed by Lilt.

Opening and switching have one recovery boundary: if initialization fails, the
session terminates, partial resources are released, and the original error is
re-raised. Window creation can allocate resources before reporting failure;
cleanup must cover that partial initialization. It retains the ordinary
manuscript and its native undo tree. Reconstructing the previous view is
unnecessary. Repeated requests for a valid active view focus the manuscript and
keep its resources and layout.

Closing or repurposing either owned window, or wiping the manuscript, ends the
session. A surviving final reference window displays the retained manuscript.
Extra user-created windows survive. The private reference buffer is deleted even
if displayed elsewhere; deliberate overrides of its protection or suppression of
lifecycle autocmds are outside the contract.

Buffer attachments are dormant outside sessions. Reload detaches Lua callbacks;
`BufReadPost` reattaches them and refreshes presentation. Deferred lifecycle checks
and reload callbacks check session identity. Ghost invalidates timers by view
lifetime and generation, then checks window, buffer, changedtick, mode, and cursor
before showing a hint. Float destruction is scheduled outside `on_lines` textlock.

## Comparison

The authoritative range contract is beside `compare.line` in the implementation.
Its paired UTF-8 byte ranges let both views decorate the same alignment. Ghost
relies on one-to-one replacement codepoints when projecting hint context across
different byte widths, and on omissions preceding real authored text. Only the
untyped reference suffix is Pending.

The alignment fixes an exact prefix, then uses semi-global Levenshtein distance:
consume all authored characters while allowing a free reference suffix.
Identical inputs always yield identical results, regardless of edit history.
Ambiguous repeated words can align as replacements plus pending text
rather than a whole-word omission. That policy is deterministic, not an inference
of intent or a promise to preserve every tie-breaking choice forever.

After the exact prefix, comparison takes O(reference length × authored length)
time and space. Session retains at most one comparison per current row, keyed by
both reference and authored text. Every draw reads the real buffer and reuses
only identical row/text pairs. Rebuilding that small cache drops removed rows;
row insertion or deletion automatically invalidates changed pairs. Switching
views reuses it, closing discards it, and reload follows the same text checks.
There is no global cache, edit replay, or parallel manuscript model. Full
presentation redraw remains simple; work preparers should keep individual units
to a manageable size.

## Presentation rationale

Ghost places inline pending suffixes at real EOL and future rows in virtual
lines. Virtual lines are not navigable buffer rows: motions, search, selection,
and scrolling remain native authored-text operations. Missing reference text
never becomes an inline placeholder. Physical blank placeholders were rejected
because native Enter, `o`, `dd`, joining, undo, and saving cannot distinguish them
from authored paragraph breaks without a second text model.

Ghost therefore favors forward copying; Split supplies independent browsing in
an ordinary protected buffer. Split chooses orientation once using two prepared
line widths plus a separator. Native resizing and rearrangement own the layout
afterwards. There are no resize callbacks, automatic view changes, cursor
synchronization, or custom navigation engines.

Hint context is projected through existing alignment spans. Word boundaries keep
it local; whitespace errors include neighbors. Long context is clipped at UTF-8
boundaries around the selected error. Hints never take focus or correct writing.
